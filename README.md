# TicTacToe-4x4

This is a project completed back in 2019 when I was in high school. This was our final project for the semester. The final project was a group project where you can have one partner and you had to track who did what on each day. We mostly alternated days. It was 50-50 on how much work was done.

Although this was a group project and a school project, it was still a big challenge at the time. I had to take everything I learned in the semester and apply it to a game that has many rules and edge cases. I also had to learn a lot more to complete the project. It was a challenge for me and also a checkpoint in how I would progress in following years.

We used C# .NET WinForms to create the GUI. We mostly learned how to program in C# rather than how to make the GUI pretty and flexible. Some challenges I ran into when creating the project were:
 - Win Conditions
 - How will I make the array
 - How should I make the board?

There were definitely better ways of making the array. I could have used an array of integers rather than buttons and "0" represents not click, "1" player 1 clicked and "2" player 2 clicked. I learned a lot from this and I am honestly pretty happy with how it came out.
